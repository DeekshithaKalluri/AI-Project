Project Summary:
This project implements and evaluates five classical pathfinding algorithms 
(A*, Dijkstra’s, IDDFS, Beam Search, and Hill Climbing) on randomly generated 2D grid environments. 
Metrics include path length, execution time, and success rate. 
Results are visualized and analyzed to determine each model’s strengths and weaknesses.
